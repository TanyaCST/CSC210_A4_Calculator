Reflection on your experience with this assignment:
This assignment is very engaging, but definitely difficult.
The most difficult part undoubtly is the infix - the converting parentheses and exponentiation to Postfix form.
Some problems I encountered is when converting parentheses, there is always a open parentheses remaining. I am so confused

This assignment does lend itself to more visual prototyping, so please feel free to go this route. Are you including slides, pseudocode, comments, or something else?
I include mostly comments and pseudocodes (As what appears in my code). I also wrote a lot in draft paper to go through the logic of the calculator (i will not show my draft paper there because it is written half in Chinese and half in English).
I really wrote a lot of comments to help me to keep track of everything.
